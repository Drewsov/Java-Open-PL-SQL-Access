# Java-Open-PL-SQL-Access
THE CHALLENGE.
You are developing a web application which is based on an OracleÆ database. You want to use
PSP (PL/SQLô Server Pages) technology along with other server-side scripting technologies,
like JSP, to build the application and leverage the power of PL/SQL where appropriate. However,
your developers are working remotely and you donít want to open direct access to the
database for them or anyone else outside your local network. Dynamic PSPô seems to be natural
choice for these requirements, but your developers are unfamiliar with its web-based development
interface or find it too simple and limited compared to web development tools like Macromedia
DreamWeaverÆ or MicrosoftÆ FrontPageÆ. You need some way to provide them with
access to the Dynamic PSP unit repository, the database and the web server without putting the
database at risk by opening it to the whole world and opening too many alternate access paths
to the web server file system. You also want your Dynamic PSP application to process requests
as quickly as possible with minimal overhead introduced by the middleware.
